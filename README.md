# Planet Dance

Planet Dance is a simple simulation of the behavior of the planets orbiting the sun.

It was not designed to be a physically correct representation of the solar system, but to make it possible to appreciate an interesting fenomena, commonly known as "The dance of Venus".

The inspiration for this project initially came from the following video (Spanish audio):
[La DANZA OCULTA de los PLANETAS del Sistema Solar | Los 5 PÃ©talos de VENUS](https://youtu.be/iFQY4dnYoVY)

Eight Earth years are roughly equal to thirteen Venus years. The ratio between the angular velocities of these two planets, is what makes them trace out a beautiful symmetrical flower pattern as they orbit the Sun.
Planet Dance allows you to create multiple planets orbiting at different angular velocities, configure their orbits and customize their trails to get fantastic looking results.
